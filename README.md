What is PocketBukkit?
============
PocketBukkit is the API for the BlockServer software.  It should come built into your BlockServer installation but if for any reason it was not, you may download the latest version at https://github.com/PocketBukkit/PocketBukkit/releases

How do I use the PocketBukkit API?
============
Download the latest version of BlockServer from http://PocketBukkit.net and add it to your plugins libraries in Eclipse.  Eclipse will then automatically tell you if you have made any syntax errors in the code.  Please note that if there are no errors that appear in Eclipse, this does NOT mean that your plugin works.
