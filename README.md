Hey guys! Its me Trent (SuperstarGamer)! Im planning on commiting a new version of PocketBukkit with (get ready) WORKING TCP Connections! (SQUEAL)! But, It can only be connected to by a test client on the PC, not MCPE itself (AW). I need to get it so the console will print out the info it retrieves info from the client. After that, Ill make the commit.
