What is PocketBukkit?
============

PocketBukkit is a free, open source Minecraft: Pocket Edition server software written in Java.  If has a built in API that
can be used to make plugins.  At the moment, PocketBukkit is still in development and may be glitchy.  New versions of the 
software will only be released when it doesn't cause any form of crash on the developers machines.  If you would like to 
contribute or report an issue, please open a new issue/pull request.

Thanks,
