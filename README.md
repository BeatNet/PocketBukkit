# PocketBukkit
---------------
PocketBukkit is a Bukkit implementation for BlockServer. This means that bukkit plugins will work with PocketBukkit as long as they don't use craftbukkit or spigot imports.

### How do I use PocketBukkit?
------------------------------
To use PocketBukkit, you can use a pre-compiled jar for stable builds. If you want the latest Dev build, then you need to compile with maven. Simply download a zip of this repo, and run "mvn clean package". Your jar will be in the "target" folder. NOTE: requires maven 3+ and Java 8 (JDK).

You can also visit our TeamCity server and download the latest JAR, built from the latest commit: http://teamcity.beaconpe.net
